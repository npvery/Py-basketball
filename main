  """This plot shows a couple things. One, there is a clear positive relationship between the two. Two, lots of preprocessing will be 
  necessary here. There are a lot of players who maybe only took a couple shots in their whole careers; make "qualified" players those 
  who took at least 100 shots during their career. Three, binning might be pretty important here; this dataset is huge, and kind of 
  unintelligible in the graph."""

###Notes: Players have multiple rows in years when they're traded. Combine these.
#Change ages to integers.
#Create "Minutes per Game" column if not included.

#Get rid of NaNs, and change ages to integers.
